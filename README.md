This script was made to help me save/like all songs within a playlist or unsave them all. 
This was needed as I needed to migrate accounts and wanted to save/like a large amount of songs at once, 
which was done by adding playlist to my new account, then running this script on them. Unsaving all songs within a playlist
was a feature added so I could add songs to a junk playlist then delete them all at once.
